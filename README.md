# Projects
This repository contains my data projects 
## PowerBi Project - Data Professionals Dashboard
This interactive dashboard can yield a plenty of summaries and insights that could assist prospective and current Data professionals in choosing a data career path.
The dataset used can be found [here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx) and a summary of the key insights can be found on my [blog](https://nabangiphyllis7.medium.com/).
## Machine Learning Project - Intrusion Detection in Industrial Control Systems
This project is about how machine learning approaches can be used for detecting cyber-attacks and problems affecting Industrial Control Systems.
The data used was made up of 15 separate datasets which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R5Q5Zc-aIteCsH5auby_g0Hs0w55mb5q/view).
## ML Models - Early-Stage Diabetes Likelihood Prediction
Built three machnine learning models (Random Forest, naïve Bayes, and artificial neural networks) to classify the early-stage diabetes likelihood prediction in patients.
Evaluated the performance of each of the three models, and basing on the cross-validation results the Random Forest model is recommended.
